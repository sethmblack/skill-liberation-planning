# Liberation Planning

Plan escape from constraining circumstances using Harriet Tubman's comprehensive "Never Lost a Passenger" methodology.

---

## When to Use

- User wants to leave a toxic job, relationship, or situation
- Planning a major life transition (career change, relocation, organizational exit)
- Feeling trapped and needing a structured escape plan
- Request for "liberation planning" or "help me escape"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| current_situation | Yes | The constraining circumstance they want to escape |
| desired_state | No | What freedom looks like (will be clarified if not provided) |
| resources | No | Available resources, timeline, constraints |
| network | No | Existing contacts or support systems |

---

## The Eight-Step Liberation Framework

### Step 1: Identify the North Star (Objective)

What is the clear destination? Freedom must be specific to be reached.

**Questions to ask:**
- What does "free" look like concretely?
- How will you know when you've crossed the line?
- What is the glory waiting on the other side?

**Tubman's insight:** "When I found I had crossed that line, I looked at my hands to see if I was the same person."

### Step 2: Name Who Needs Liberation

Identify everyone affected by this journey - not just yourself.

**Questions to ask:**
- Are you escaping alone or bringing others?
- Who depends on your success?
- Who would be endangered if you fail?

**Tubman's insight:** She returned 13 times - not for herself, but for family and others still enslaved.

### Step 3: Map the Obstacles (The Dogs and Torches)

Be honest about what stands between you and freedom.

**Obstacles to identify:**
- Financial barriers (debt, lack of savings, income dependency)
- Social barriers (expectations, relationships, reputation)
- Practical barriers (contracts, non-competes, location)
- Psychological barriers (fear, uncertainty, impostor syndrome)
- Active opposition (people who benefit from your captivity)

**Tubman's insight:** "If you hear the dogs, keep going. If you see the torches in the woods, keep going."

### Step 4: Build the Network (Stationmasters and Safe Houses)

No one liberates alone. Identify your support infrastructure.

**Network elements:**
- **Stationmasters:** Key allies who will actively help (mentors, sponsors, close friends)
- **Safe houses:** Fallback positions if the escape stalls (crash space, emergency funds, temporary work)
- **Information sources:** People who know the territory ahead
- **Fellow travelers:** Others making similar journeys who can support each other

**Tubman's insight:** "I couldn't have saved a single soul if there weren't people willing to open their doors in the night."

### Step 5: Choose the Timing (Saturday Night)

Select the optimal moment to move.

**Timing factors:**
- When is observation lowest? (Tubman left Saturday nights - no newspapers until Monday)
- When do you have maximum runway?
- What cycles or deadlines create natural transition points?
- What conditions provide cover (others are distracted, busy season ends, etc.)?

**Tubman's insight:** Strategic timing isn't cowardice - it's wisdom.

### Step 6: Plan the Route (Every Step)

Map the journey from current state to freedom.

**Route elements:**
- **Phase 1:** Preparation while still in place (quiet accumulation of resources, network cultivation)
- **Phase 2:** The move itself (resignation, departure, announcement)
- **Phase 3:** The vulnerable period (between the old and the new)
- **Phase 4:** Arrival and establishment in the new state

**For each phase:** Specific actions, timeline, contingencies

### Step 7: Prepare for Courage (What Enables Action)

Fear is natural. Preparation enables action despite fear.

**Courage enablers:**
- Clear conviction about the rightness of the journey
- Thorough preparation that addresses specific fears
- Support from network when courage wavers
- The "liberty or death" commitment - no turning back

**Tubman's insight:** "'Twant me, 'twas the Lord. I always told him, 'I trust to you. I don't know where to go or what to do, but I expect you to lead me,' and He always did."

### Step 8: Execute - Keep Going

Once you start moving, don't stop.

**Execution principles:**
- Forward motion is survival
- Don't look back
- Adapt to obstacles but never retreat
- The path gets clearer as you walk it

**Tubman's insight:** "Don't ever stop. Keep going. If you want a taste of freedom, keep going."

**Output:**

## Liberation Plan: Corporate Escape

### Your North Star
Work that respects your contribution, offers growth, and doesn't poison your evenings and weekends. A place where you look at your hands at the end of the day and feel like a person, not a cog.

### Who Travels With You
Your family depends on this income - they travel with you. Your successful escape means their stability. But they also suffer under the current arrangement - your stress, your diminished energy, your Sunday dread affects them too.

### The Dogs and Torches (Obstacles)
| Obstacle | Type | Mitigation |
|----------|------|------------|
| Mortgage payments | Financial | 6-month emergency fund target; no move without 3 months secured |
| Outdated skills | Practical | 90-day skill update plan; certifications that travel |
| Kids' school stability | Social | Timeline aligned with school year; no mid-year disruption |
| Fear of unknown | Psychological | Network with people who've made similar moves |
| Golden handcuffs (vesting, tenure) | Financial | Calculate exact cost; is the vesting worth the soul cost? |

### Your Underground Railroad (Network)
**Stationmasters:** Former colleagues who've left successfully; recruiters in your field; that friend who keeps saying "I could get you an interview"
**Safe Houses:** Severance negotiation (if you're pushed); consulting/contract work as bridge; your spouse's income as partial safety net
**Information Sources:** LinkedIn contacts at target companies; industry Slack channels; former boss who moved to better place

### Saturday Night (Timing)
**Optimal window:** Start preparation now; execute move in 6-9 months
**Runway needed:** 3-month emergency fund minimum; 1-2 solid leads before giving notice
**Cover conditions:** Year-end/new-year is natural transition; annual review season opens conversations; Q1 hiring surge at most companies

### The Route
**Phase 1 - Preparation (Months 1-6):**
- Update resume and LinkedIn this weekend
- Identify 3 skills to update; begin one course immediately
- Have 2 coffee conversations per month with external contacts
- Build emergency fund to 3-month target
- Research 10 target companies

**Phase 2 - The Move (Months 6-8):**
- Begin active applications once you have 3-month runway
- Interview while employed (use PTO strategically)
- Resign only with offer in hand
- Negotiate start date for 2-week buffer minimum

**Phase 3 - The Vulnerable Period (Month 8-9):**
- Two-week notice period: professional, complete, no burning bridges
- The gap: if any, use for rest and reset
- First 90 days: head down, learn fast, prove value

**Phase 4 - Arrival:**
- By month 9-10: settled in new role
- The past falls away faster than you expect

### What Enables Your Courage
You've survived 8 years in a toxic environment. That took strength. The journey ahead is shorter and leads somewhere better. Your family needs the person you'll become after you're free, not the diminished version this place is creating.

### The Command
**This week:** Update your LinkedIn profile. One hour. That's the first step into the woods. Once you take it, the next step becomes visible.

Keep going.
